# Collection
A collection of my papers, presentations and other research material

## Microservices
This folder contains my academic paper on microservices - 'MICROSERVICES - Divide and Conquer'. It is conceptually based on the article 'The Hidden Dividends of Microservices' by Tom Killalea.

## Software Testing Mini Blogs
This folder contains the mini blogs on software testing that I wrote on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) during the semester when I took a software testing class.
