### This is a documentation of my efforts in NLP and Sentiment Analysis using R.

I have used the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and performed analysis on restaurant reviews. This is an on-going research. The yelp data is available in JSON and SQL. The same dataset in the form of CSVs is also available [here](www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) on Kaggle which I have used for this project.

### What have I accomplished so far?
- Explored the R libraries:
  - `tidytext`
  - `dplyr`
  - `tidyr`
- Explored the pros and cons of the lexicons available:
  - `afinn`
  - `bing`
  - `nrc`
- Performed sentiment analysis on unigrams (one word).

### Future
- Relationships between words (n-grams)
- Topic modelling


I have referred to [`Text Mining with R`](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) book by O'Reilly, and their website tutorial is great for beginners like me in this area.
